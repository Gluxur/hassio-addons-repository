# Home Assistant Add-on: Somfy Protexial IO Proxy

Connects to your [Somfy Protexial IO](https://www.somfypro.fr/assistance/alarme) alarm and provides a custom REST API, in order to interact in a simple and bidirectional way.

This plug-in does not allow you to interact with your alarm from Home Assistant, it is a prerequisite to allow the "Somfy Protexial IO Gateway" add-on to operate.
